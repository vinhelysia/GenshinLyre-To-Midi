# GenshinLyre-To-Midi

This project provides a tool to convert musical notes played on the Lyre instrument in the game Genshin Impact into MIDI files. These MIDI files are specifically generated for use with [GenshinLyreMidiPlayer][https://github.com/sabihoshi/GenshinLyreMidiPlayer], a software that plays MIDI files in the style of the Lyre instrument from Genshin Impact. This allows users to export their in-game musical creations and play them back using GenshinLyreMidiPlayer.

## What is MIDI?

MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard that allows electronic musical instruments, computers, and other devices to communicate with each other. In this context, the tool converts your in-game Lyre performances into MIDI files tailored for playback in GenshinLyreMidiPlayer.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vinhelysia/GenshinLyre-To-Midi.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd GenshinLyre-To-Midi
   ```
4. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note:** If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, you may need to manually install dependencies such as `midiutil`. Check the project files or documentation for specific requirements.

## Usage

1. Prepare your input file. The input should be a text file where each line represents a note or a chord played on the Lyre. Each note should be in the format `NoteOctave` (e.g., `C4`, `D#5`), and chords can be specified by listing multiple notes separated by spaces. Each line corresponds to a quarter note at a tempo of 120 BPM.

   Example `input.txt`:
   ```
   C4
   E4
   G4
   C4 E4 G4
   ```

2. Run the script with the input file:
   ```
   python main.py input.txt output.mid
   ```
   This will generate a MIDI file named `output.mid` based on the notes in `input.txt`.

   **Note:** The tool assumes a fixed duration (quarter note) and tempo (120 BPM). For custom durations or tempos, you may need to modify the script.

3. **Using the MIDI file with GenshinLyreMidiPlayer:**
   - Load the generated MIDI file into [GenshinLyreMidiPlayer](https://example.com/genshinlyremidiplayer) to play it back using the Lyre instrument simulation.
   - Ensure the MIDI file is configured correctly in GenshinLyreMidiPlayer, such as selecting the appropriate instrument or channel for playback.
   - For more details, refer to the [GenshinLyreMidiPlayer documentation](https://example.com/genshinlyremidiplayer-docs).

## Compatibility

The MIDI files generated by this tool are designed specifically for GenshinLyreMidiPlayer. While they may work with other MIDI playback software, compatibility and optimal performance are ensured with GenshinLyreMidiPlayer.
